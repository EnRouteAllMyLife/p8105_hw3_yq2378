# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

The data has 1384617 observations of 15 variables, where each row in the
dataset is a product from an order. `order_id` is order identifier.
`user_id` is customer identifier. `order_dow` is the day of the week on
which the order was placed. `order_hour_of_day` is the hour of the day
on which the order was placed. `product_name` is the name of the
product. `aisle` is the name of the aisle. `department` is the name of
the department. The following table gives a more detailed summary of the
variables.

``` r
skimr::skim(instacart)

There are 134 unique aisles and fresh vegetables is the most items
ordered from. Fresh fruits comes the second and packaged vegetables
fruit comes the third.

Grouped the data by aisle and reorder the data by the number of items
ordered in each aisle, we could easily see that the number of fresh
vegetables and fruits are almost twice as that of packaged vegetables
fruits. The least popular items are dry pasta, oil vinegars and butter.

``` r
instacart %>% group_by(aisle) %>% summarise(cnt = n()) %>%  filter(cnt>10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, cnt), y = cnt))+ geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label = cnt, y = 5000), cex = 2, col ='white')+
  xlab("Aisle") + theme_pubclean()
```

# Problem 2

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r

  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor","Excellent"), ordered = TRUE))
```

In 2002, 6 states, including PA, MA, NJ, CT, FL, NC were observed at 7
or more locations. In 2010, 14 states were left, including FL, NJ, TX,
CA, MD, NC, NE,WA, MA,NY,OH, Co, PA, SC were observed at 7 or more
locations. Details were listed below.

The dataset `brfss_smart_excellent` contains 443 observations of 3
variables. From 2002 to 2010, mean data value across 51 states were
presented by the “spaghetti” plot. Generally the lines were in a
decreasing trend.

Distributions of `data_value` in different year and of different
position is shown below.Clearly, for both 2006 and 2010, the Poor has
lower data value compared to the Excellence. The max value of the poor
never exceeds the Q1 of the Excellence. Rough little difference could be
detetced between 2006 and 2010.

``` r
brfss_smart_excellent = brfss_smart2010 %>% filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(year,locationabbr) %>% summarise(mean_data_value = mean(data_value))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
